advantages of function overloading in c++
the program is very simple and also easier to understand.
it saves the memory space, maintains consistency, makes clear interface for methods
regardless of the parameters type and readability of the program.
using the function overloading concept, we can develop more than one function with the same
name, but hte arguments passed should be of differents types.
function overloading executes the program faster.
function overloading is used for cide reuseability and to save memory.

disadvantages of function overloading in c++
function declarations that differ by their return type cannot be overloaded with the 
function overloading process.
if any static member function is declared, then the same parameters or
the same name types cannot be overloaded.
